      This webpage was created to showcase the logo i created for whale design
      studio. it includes but is not limited to the process of creating the
      logo.

		Here are some of my thoughts about creating this logo design:
	</font>
    </h2>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>
        I created this logo in adobe illustrator. I primarily used the pen 	tool
        and the direct selection tool to modify points. I also used the
        rectangle shape tool.
      </li>
      <li>I chose to use an analogous color scheme for this logo.. etc..</li>
      <li>
        i feel this logo appeals to the target audience for several reasons.
        etc...
      </li>
      <li>
        the name of the business, Whale Design Studio has a quirky sort of 	feel.
        the whale icon fits the quirky kind of vibe
      </li>
    </ul>
